## The Client

SleepInc has shared anonymized sleep data from its new and popular sleep tracking app, SleepScope. As their data science consultant, they have requested an analysis of the lifestyle survey data to uncover relationships between exercise, gender, occupation, and sleep quality.

## ðŸ’¾ The Data: sleep_health_data.csv

SleepInc has provided us with a dataset containing metrics on sleep quality and lifestyle from 374 individuals. The dataset includes average values over the last 6 months.

The dataset includes 13 columns, encompassing sleep duration, quality, sleep disorders, exercise, stress, diet, and other demographic data useful for analysis.
